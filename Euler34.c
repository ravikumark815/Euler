/*
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

/* The upper search bound is 2540160. If the upper bound has 6 digits, the

 * every numbers between 1 and 999999 can be a curious number. If the upper
 * bound has 7 digits, the maximum achievable sum is 7*9! = 2540160, so all
 * the numbers after 2540160 can not be a curious number as the sum of the
 * factorial of its digits will be less than 2540160 so less than itself
