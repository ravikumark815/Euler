Project Euler is a series of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills. Somebody who enjoys learning a new coding language, Euler Project is going to be a fun journey.

I code each problem in C and the correct solution for the same is shown below:

Euler 1 - 233168
Euler 2 - 4613732
